# My-Portfolio
Currently in my third year pursuing B.Tech-CSE. I have
secured 8.48 CGPA and have several skills
including Data Analysis, JAVA, C, C++.

I have worked with several companies as an intern like
Eventbeep, Internshala etc, as a student ambassador as
well as marketing strategist. I have also worked on my
social skills as well as communication skills for better
people management to lead a team, moreover I have
done several course from Linkedin learning on time
management to get an efficient balance.

I was also part of my college IEEE group where I learnt
a great amount of new skills and also worked closely with
many hardware projects based on Iot. Ihave recently
completed my R programming course from Infoysys
learning site.

As I am a fresher it would be great to experience the
real challenges of the corporate world and understand
how things work. Being a fresher, I think I am very
flexible and adaptive to learn new things. I have
theoretical knowledge. But I am waiting to use my
theoretical knowledge in a practical way. And I believe
by putting significant efforts I will learn.
